Recraft offers software consulting services in the following areas: 

- _*Recrafting existing R code*_ into an R package that can be distributed globally via GitHub or even through CRAN (if accepted there). Or even creating new custom R packages from scratch.
- _*Containerization or cloudification*_ of existing IT systems using Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) tools and techniques so it can run in a modular and portable fashion in the cloud (or locally) as Docker containers.
- _*Modernization of Traditional Applications*_ - aka [MTA](https://goto.docker.com/MTAkit.html) - often involving a webification of software applications that might presently be locked-in to a particular non-FOSS OS or platform. This can mean converting a desktop application into a web application, so that it can run in the cloud, on the web (too).
- _*IaaS efforts*_ involving deployment, maintenance and operations of cloud based software services
