Recraft is a one person limited company that offers software consulting services in the following areas: 

- *Recrafting existing R code* into an R package that can be distributed globally through CRAN or via GitHub, or even creating new R packages from scratch.
- *Containerization or cloudification* of existing IT systems using Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) tools and techniques so it can run in a modular and portable fashion in the cloud (or locally) as a Docker container.
- *Modernization of Traditional Applications* - aka [MTA](https://goto.docker.com/MTAkit.html) - often meaning a webification of software applications that might presently be locked-in to a particular non-FOSS OS or platform. This can mean converting a desktop application into a web application, so that it can run in the cloud, on the web (too).
- *IaaS efforts* involving deployment, maintenance and operations of cloud based software services
